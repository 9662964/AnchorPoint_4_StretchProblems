 # Thursday Stretch Problem 4.4
 ## Obj-C FizzBuzz
 
 ### Instructions:
 1. Make a new Objective-C Project
 2. Write a method that prints the numbers from 1 to an inputed number. But for multiples of three print "Dev" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Mtn". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "DevMtn".
 
 ### Black Diamond ðŸ’ŽðŸ’ŽðŸ’Ž
