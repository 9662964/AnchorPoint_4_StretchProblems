 ## Obj-C Highest Number in Array
 
 ### Instructions
 1. Make a new Objective-C Project
 2. Write a method that prints the highest number in an array (that is stored as a property).
 3. Change your method to take an array as a parameter and return the highest number. Once you do this, you can comment out your property and just make an array to use.
 
 ### Black Diamond ðŸ’ŽðŸ’ŽðŸ’Ž
 Modify your function so it also prints out the second highest number in the array.
